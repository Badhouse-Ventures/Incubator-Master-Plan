# Badhouse Ventures - Incubator Master Plan

We're building a hands-on, founder-friendly, pre-seed incubator-studio focusing on the data value chain and solving big problems. As we continue to assemble a crack team of collaborators from diverse backgrounds and some kick-ass investor partners, we're open-sourcing the high-level version of our master plan. We're starting with a manifesto and (soon) a high-level business model.

Yes, that means that we're looking for feedback from startup founders, past and present, so go ahead and post issues or make pull requests on anything in this repo outside of this README file! Help us refine what things should be like to best support early-stage venture founders.

>If you're short on time or have nothing to suggest for the plan, but still want to show your support for this initiative, we ask that you please **star the repository** and **share it** with those who might be interested. We would, of course, also graciously accept any Bitcoin donations sent to [156HAFYoxeaVVg7vpt6dmcqqRR9pNf4HSv](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/156HAFYoxeaVVg7vpt6dmcqqRR9pNf4HSv/) to help speed up our launch.

### What's an _incubator-studio_?

Good question! There's a lot of inconsistent usage for terms like "accelerator" and "incubator". To complicate matters, there are sub-categories (such as a "corporate incubators") and even regional variations. For clarity, here is how we define the following, based on what we see in the Canadian context:
* _Accelerator_: An organisation that provides training programs, mentorship, connections and, often, office space to early-stage startup founders. Typically there is some fee to access these services, at minimum for the office space. Accelerators are quite common and typically have cohorts that range in duration from 3 to 6 months.
* _Incubator_: These generally offer the same types of services as an accelerator, but make a small investment in the startup in exchange for a small equity stake, either directly or a convertible instrument for future equity. These are extremely rare in Canada; in the US, a good example is Techstars, recently expanded with programs in Toronto and Montreal, though they call themselves an "accelerator"!
* _Startup-studio_: An organisation with a core team, that generates many ideas internally and builds several startup teams in parallel, following on with those that gain some traction. This type of group is often called a _startup foundry_. One example of such an organisation is TandemLaunch in Montreal.

Which brings us to what we're building, an **_incubator-studio_**. We describe this hybrid as:
* Providing funds in exchange for equity and mentorship like an incubator, but also getting involved in building the startup. This should feel like having an additional minority co-founder.
* Though providing some human capital to the selected ventures like a startup-studio, potential ventures are beyond the ideation stage, are sourced externally and selection is heavily based on the quality of the founders pitching the projects.
* The goal is to mature the incubated ventures so that they are quickly ready for the next level of investment. This can look like: Helping the startup go through the build-test-learn cycles faster, refining a prototype to become a true minimally-viable product, jumpstarting the growth in users or finding the first paying client.

### Backstory

In addition to sheer love of building startups, the motivations for creating this new incubator-studio based in Vancouver (but open to the world!) are based on a few key trends:

* There's an investment gap that's growing between the initial startup phase (side-hustling, ramen noodles, love money and/or government grants) and the new, much higher bar of seed capital investment â€” often $1-2M rounds (unless you're in the United States, where TechCrunch found that the typical range is now $2-5M USD).

* There's a growing number of low added-value accelerators popping up in major cities around the world that are not meeting the immediate needs of startup founders. Though many mean well, a large proportion of these are glorified training programs, or a so-called "bootcamps". Though learning the ins and outs of lean product development, customer development, branding, legal, go-to-market strategy, hiring, etc., is never a bad thing, founders need more than this.

* Moving to Silicon Valley without a Silicon Valley job is getting increasingly harder, whether due to skyrocketing rents or much tighter immigration rules. It's not just entrepreneurial startup founders who are having a rethink; there's an acceleration of West Coast US-based tech firms opening up R&D offices North of the border in Vancouver, Canada, in the same time-zone, a 2-hour flight away from San Francisco (a 1-hour flight or 3-hour drive from Seattle). Certainly not the cheapest city, but central one-bedroom flats and company offices can be rented in Vancouver for more than half the price as in the Valley.

### Who are we?

The Badhouse team is not yet finalised, nor is our website, as we have not officially launched! So far, the team we're building tentatively includes ex-founders, ex-consultants, a PhD, a solution architect, those that have had roles on the investment side of the table, men, women, and those who have lived in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.
