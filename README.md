# Badhouse Ventures - Incubator Master Plan

We're building a hands-on, founder-friendly, pre-seed incubator-studio focusing on the data value chain and solving big problems. As we continue to assemble a crack team of collaborators from diverse backgrounds and some kick-ass investor partners, we're open-sourcing the high-level version of our master plan. We're starting with a manifesto and (soon) a high-level business model.

Yes, that means that we're looking for feedback from startup founders, past and present, so go ahead and post issues or make pull requests on anything in this repo outside of this README file! Help us refine what things should be like to best support early-stage venture founders.

>If you're short on time or have nothing to suggest for the plan, but still want to show your support for this initiative, we ask that you please **star the repository** and **share it** with those who might be interested. We would, of course, also graciously accept any Bitcoin donations sent to [156HAFYoxeaVVg7vpt6dmcqqRR9pNf4HSv](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/156HAFYoxeaVVg7vpt6dmcqqRR9pNf4HSv/) to help speed up our launch.

### What's an _incubator-studio_?

Good question! There's a lot of inconsistent usage for terms like "accelerator" and "incubator". To complicate matters, there are sub-categories (such as a "corporate incubators") and even regional variations. For clarity, here is how we define the following, based on what we see in the Canadian context:
* _Accelerator_: An organisation that provides training programs, mentorship, connections and, often, office space to early-stage startup founders. There is sometimes a fee to access these services or for the office space. Accelerators are quite common and typically have cohorts that last around 3 months. A minority of accelerators, like Techstars, also provide some capital for each venture in the cohort. In Canada, there are currently no investing-accelerators for technology startups west of Toronto/Waterloo. 
* _Incubator_: These generally offer the same types of services as an accelerator, but have programs that last a longer period, often a year. Incubators typically choose to focus on a particular phase of the startup lifecycle, many chosing to target the very beginning, the idea stage.
* _Startup-studio_: An organisation that generates many ideas internally, builds teams to work on these ideas, and then spins out independent startup companies for the projects that gain some traction. This type of group is often called a _startup foundry_. Examples of such organisations include TandemLaunch, Expa, or Idealab.

Which brings us to what we're building, an **_incubator-studio_**. We describe this hybrid as:
* Providing pre-seed capital in exchange for equity and support over a longer period, like an incubator, but also getting involved in building the startup. This should feel like having an additional minority co-founder.
* Though providing some human capital to the selected ventures like a startup-studio, potential ventures are beyond the ideation stage and are sourced externally through a selection process.
* The goal is to mature the incubated ventures so that they become ready for the next level of investment. This can look like: Helping the startup go through build-test-learn cycles, refining a prototype to become a true minimally-viable product, jumpstarting the growth in users, or finding the first paying enterprise client.

### Backstory

In addition to sheer love of building startups, the motivations for creating this new incubator-studio based in Vancouver (but open to the world!) are based on a few key trends:

* There's an investment gap that's growing between the initial startup phase (side-hustling, ramen noodles, love money and/or government grants) and the new, much higher bar of "seed" capital investment â€” often $1-2M rounds (unless you're in the United States, where TechCrunch found that the typical range is now $2-5M USD). In Canada, venture funds, as well as angel investors, typically focus on later-stage (less risky) startups. As a result, pre-seed investment is getting harder to find.

* Given the rarity of pre-seed investors, founders without large personal savings are at a disadvantage. Those that are not able to forego a year of salary to work on their early-stage startup must either maintain stable employment and moonlight their startup work, or get consulting and "dev-for-hire" work to subsidize their remaining time to work on their startup venture. This is potentially resulting in a socioeconomic bias to the speed of venture development, but also eventual startup successs.

* There's a growing number of low added-value accelerators popping up in major cities around the world that are not meeting the immediate needs of startup founders. Though many mean well, a large proportion of these are glorified training programs, or a so-called "bootcamps". Though learning the ins and outs of lean product development, customer development, branding, legal, go-to-market strategy, hiring, etc., is never a bad thing, founders need more than this.

* Moving to Silicon Valley (in the hopes of increasing the chances of finding pre-seed startup investment) without a Silicon Valley job is getting increasingly harder, whether due to skyrocketing rents or much tighter immigration rules. It's not just entrepreneurial startup founders who are having a rethink; there's an acceleration of international tech firms opening up R&D offices in Vancouver, Canada, in the same time-zone, a 2-hour flight away from San Francisco (a 1-hour flight or 3-hour drive from Seattle). Certainly not the cheapest city, but central one-bedroom flats and company offices can be rented in Vancouver for more than half the price as in the Valley.

### Who are we?

The Badhouse team is not yet finalised, as we have not officially started incubating our first cohort of ventures! So far, the team we're building tentatively includes ex-founders, ex-consultants, former researchers, product managers, those that have had roles on the investment side of the table, men, women, and those who have lived in North America, Europe, and Asia.
