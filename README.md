# Badhouse Ventures - Master Plan

We're building up a hands-on, founder-friendly, pre-seed "incubator-studio" focusing on the data value chain and solving big problems. As we continue to grow a crack team of collaborators from diverse backgrounds and some kick-ass investor partners, we've kept this high-level version of our master plan open-sourced.

Yes, it means that we're open for feedback from startup founders, past and present, so go ahead and post issues or make pull requests on anything in this repo! Help us refine how best to support very early-stage venture founders.

### What's an _incubator-studio_?

Good question! There's a lot of inconsistent usage for terms like "accelerator" and "incubator". To complicate matters, there are sub-categories (such as a "corporate incubators") and even regional variations. For clarity, here is how we define the following, based on what we see in the Canadian context:
* _Accelerator_: An organisation that provides training programs, mentorship, connections and, often, office space to early-stage startup founders. There is sometimes a fee to access these services or for the office space. Accelerators are quite common and typically have cohorts that last around 3 months. A minority of accelerators, like Techstars, also provide some capital for each venture in the cohort. In Canada, there are currently no investing-accelerators (i.e., that invest in the full cohort) for technology startups west of Toronto/Waterloo. 
* _Incubator_: These generally offer the same types of services as an accelerator, but have programs that last a longer period, often a year. Incubators typically choose to focus on a particular phase of the startup lifecycle, many chosing to target the very beginning, the idea stage.
* _Startup-studio_: An organisation that generates many ideas internally, builds teams to work on these ideas, and then spins out independent startup companies for the projects that gain some traction. This type of group is often called a _startup foundry_ or _venture studio_. Examples of such organisations include TandemLaunch, Expa, Harvest Builders, or Idealab.

Which brings us to what we're building, an **_incubator-studio_**. We invented the term and describe this hybrid as:
* Providing pre-seed capital in exchange for equity and support over a longer period, like an incubator, but also getting involved in building the startup. This should feel like having an additional minority co-founder.
* Though providing some human capital to the selected ventures like a startup-studio, potential ventures are beyond the ideation stage and are sourced externally through a selection process.
* The goal is to mature the incubated ventures so that they become ready for the next level of investment. This can look like: Helping the startup go through build-test-learn cycles, refining a prototype to become a true minimally-viable product, jumpstarting the growth in users, or finding the first paying enterprise client.

### Backstory

In addition to sheer love of building startups, the motivations for creating this new incubator-studio based in Vancouver, Canada, are based on a few key trends:

* There's an investment gap that's growing between the initial startup phase (side-hustling, ramen noodles, love money and/or government grants) and the new, much higher bar of "seed" capital investment â€” often $1-5M rounds. In Canada, venture funds, as well as angel investors, typically focus on post-revenue (less risky) startups. As a result, pre-seed investment is getting harder to find.

* Given the rarity of pre-seed investors, founders without large personal savings are at a disadvantage. Those that are not able to forego a year of salary to work on their early-stage startup must either maintain stable employment and moonlight their startup work, or get consulting and "dev-for-hire" work to subsidize their remaining time to work on their startup venture. This is generating a socioeconomic bias to venture development speed, but also eventual startup successs.

* There's a growing number of low quality, low added-value accelerators popping up in major cities around the world that are not meeting the immediate needs of startup founders. Though many mean well, a large proportion of these are glorified training programs, or a so-called "bootcamps". Though learning the ins and outs of lean product development, customer development, branding, legal, go-to-market strategy, hiring, etc., is never a bad thing, founders need more than this.
